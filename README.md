# üçÖ Tomates Podridos üçÖ 

This is a paired project using React to build an application that allows the user to view all movies, search movie by title, and filter movies based on different categories. The user is also able to click on a see more details button to view the movie's tagline, overview, rating, release date, genres, and runtime if available from the api data available.

## Project Specs

View the spec for this project [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html).

When the Rancid Tomatillos app loads, the user will see the home page with all movies displayed. Each movie card includes the movie's cover photo, title, and Rancid Tomatillo rating.

## API

For this project, we access data from two API's.

Movie and user data is accessed via the following API, built by staff at Turing.

[Movie Data API](https://rancid-tomatillos.herokuapp.com/api/v1)

Our team gave ourselves the challenge to learn and implement Express to build an API that stores all user ratings. See both the API and repo below.
