Looking for a great flick for your Friday night? *Tomates Podridos* has you covered! This totally not "Rotten Tomatoes" site will give you the lowdown on all the latest movies.

## Overview
*Tomates Podridos* was a paired project for Mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design.
Our objective was to build a React app in a short time and consume a movie api to create a Movie Streaming/Rating site.
We also used Cypress to test to achieve Acceptance and End-to-End testing.


## Features
- View a list of movies
- Click on the desired movie to see details and watch a trailer (if available)
- Click back to the homepage via back button or clicking on the logo
- Tested with Cypress
